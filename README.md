# Appointment Scheduler

This project is a simple web-based appointment scheduler application that allows users to add, view, update, and delete appointments. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and interacts with a mock API server to perform CRUD operations.

## Features

- **Add Appointment**: Users can add new appointments by providing the date, time, and client name through a form.
- **View Appointments**: Existing appointments are displayed in a table format, showing the appointment ID, date, time, and client name.
- **Edit Appointment**: Users can edit existing appointments by clicking the "Update" button, which allows them to modify the appointment details.
- **Delete Appointment**: Appointments can be deleted individually by clicking the "Delete" button. A confirmation popup is displayed before deletion.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Frontend Development**: The project demonstrates proficiency in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript is used to dynamically update the DOM based on user actions, such as adding, editing, or deleting appointments.
- **Form Validation**: Form validation is implemented to ensure that users provide valid input for date and time fields.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: AJAX requests are made to interact with the mock API server asynchronously, allowing for smooth data retrieval and manipulation.
- **CRUD Operations**: The application performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on appointment data stored on the server.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language used for creating the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling language used for designing the layout and appearance of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for implementing interactive features and functionality.
- **XMLHttpRequest**: JavaScript API used for making asynchronous HTTP requests to the server.
- **Mock API Server**: A mock API server is used to simulate backend functionality for storing and retrieving appointment data.
